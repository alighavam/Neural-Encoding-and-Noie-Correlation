# Neural-Encoding-and-Noie-Correlation
• ISI and CV were calculated for simulated neural data from simple and leaky integrate
and fire neuron models and also real neural recordings. Then, the lower variability in
computational models was fixed by adding inhibitory neurons to the leaky model. It
also suggests a dynamic for higher spiking variability in real neural circuits.

• Processing real neural data first in single unit and then, in population using a dimensionality reduction algorithm (PCA) to see the performance of each processing method
in explaining the encoding of the task conditions.

• Finding tuning curve of neurons in V1 and constructing the orientation color map in
the area. Then, investigating the effect of similarity of neuron responses on noise correlation.
